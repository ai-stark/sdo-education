				<p>The most common health IT standards focus on allowing for the electronic recording and exchange of data. The federal government requires some standards to be used via regulation, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>HIPAA 5010 X12 transaction standards, such as 270, 271, 834, 835, and 837 for administrative transactions;</li>
						<li>ICD-10 for coding diagnosis on claims;</li>
						<li>C-CDA for sending transitions of care and providing electronic information to patients;</li>
						<li>RxNorm for coding medications and allergies;</li>
						<li>SCRIPT for sending electronic prescriptions;</li>
						<li>And many more.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>ONC has provided a <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/meaningful-use-stage-2-0/2015-standards-hub">Standards Hub</a> that includes a list of all of the standards required by the 2015 Edition Certification Criteria, who developed and maintains the standards, a link the standard or implementation guide, and a crosswalk to the criteria that require the use of the standard. ONC has also provided the <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/standards-advisory">Interoperability Standards Advisory (ISA)</a> that provides a list of the "best available" interoperability standards and implementation standards for industry use to fulfill specific clinical health IT interoperability needs. In addition, the National Library of Medicine maintains a <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hit_interoperability.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hub</a> for vocabulary standards that provides users with an explanation of each vocabulary standard and easy access to the vocabulary standards used to support interoperability.</p>

					<p>SDOs typically have varying levels of membership that can range from providing individuals with the opportunity to provide feedback on standards to allowing individuals to prioritize and develop standards. If you have encountered an issue with a particular standard in the field, you can engage with the SDO directly to provide them feedback on the standard. Alternately, if you’re unsure of how to engage with these organizations, you can provide your feedback directly to ONC, who will work with the SDO to help them understand what your issue might be.</p>
